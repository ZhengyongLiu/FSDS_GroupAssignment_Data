    "\n",
    "This study focuses on analysing the composition and revenue profile of the ENTIRE room type of listings in Airbnb. The so-called entire room refers to a whole house for rent, and the rise of Airbnb has led to many landlords who originally belonged to the traditional long-term rental market, attracted by the high profits of the platform, gradually withdrawing from the housing supply market in London and placing their properties for short-term rentals on Airbnb instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The research methodology is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 2016 and 2019 were chosen as the time points for analysis in this study, given data completeness, due to the fact that London's private housing rental statistics and property ownership data are only updated to 2019.\n",
    "2. Borough-level analysis to maintain consistency. Extracted Airbnb entire room listings using specific code from insideairbnb. Estimated revenue using an average of 50 annual rental days per listing.\n",

    "## 7.5 Conclusion & Recommendations\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n",
    "The proposed policy recommendations focus on creating a balanced and sustainable rental market in London, amidst the growing influence of Airbnb. Key measures include establishing regulations to limit the conversion of long-term rental properties into short-term Airbnb listings, particularly in highly impacted areas. To protect affordable housing, policies should enforce the dedication of units like coach houses to long-term rentals, countering their use for short-term tourist accommodations. Additionally, introducing profit-sharing mechanisms or higher taxation on Airbnb profits could help equalize the attractiveness of both rental types. Mandatory data sharing from platforms like Airbnb would aid in effective monitoring and policy formulation. Finally, offering incentives or subsidies to property owners who commit to long-term rentals, especially in areas with high demand, could further support the stability and affordability of the long-term rental market. These strategies aim to harmonize the growth of short-term rental platforms with the broader housing needs of the community.\n",
