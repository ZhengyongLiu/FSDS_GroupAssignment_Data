\hypertarget{who-collected-the-data}{%
\subsection{1. Who collected the data?}\label{who-collected-the-data}}

\href{http://insideairbnb.com/about/}{Inside Airbnb}'s data was chiefly
collected by Murray Cox, its founder, who leverages his skills in
community activism, art, and data for social change. The project also
benefits from contributions by John Morris, a key collaborator
responsible for the website's design and major reports, and Taylor
Higgins, who focuses on data organization and community building.
Additional support comes from various past collaborators and an advisory
board, each contributing unique expertise to the analysis and
presentation of Airbnb's impact on communities.

\hypertarget{why-did-they-collect-it}{%
\subsection{2. Why did they collect it?}\label{why-did-they-collect-it}}

The data on London's Airbnb locations, types, availability and rental
prices is collected to inform data-driven public service and policy
innovation. This approach aims to address complex urban planning and
housing issues by analyzing housing market dynamics and
population-related factors to improve policy decisions.

\hypertarget{how-was-the-data-collected}{%
\subsection{3. How was the data
collected?}\label{how-was-the-data-collected}}

The data featured on the `Inside Airbnb' website was primarily collected
from the Airbnb Website itself, offering a comprehensive range of
information such as property listings, availability calendars, customer
reviews, and detailed metrics for listings in various regions and cities
globally. Additionally, the project also involves collaboration with
outside contributors who choose to participate. These collaborators,
possibly from various professional backgrounds or with specific
expertise, contribute to enhancing and expanding the data collection
process.

\subsection{4. How does the method of collection impact the completeness
and/or accuracy of its representation of the process it seeks to study,

The collection of Airbnb data, excluding private listings, faces
limitations like time lags and lacks insights into private
communications or internal policies (Slee, n.d.). Changes in Airbnb's
website structure can impact data accuracy, and privacy concerns arise
regarding personal information. Policymakers using this data risk
introducing biases, potentially leading to ineffective or unfair
policies, and users must be aware of these constraints to avoid
incorrect inferences (Slee, n.d.).

\hypertarget{what-ethical-considerations-does-the-use-of-this-data-raise}{%
\subsection{5. What ethical considerations does the use of this data
raise?}\label{what-ethical-considerations-does-the-use-of-this-data-raise}}

It's crucial to navigate a complex web of ethical and legal
considerations, including privacy, data ownership, and user consent.
Ethical data handling mandates not only transparency in collection,
processing, and usage but also adherence to principles like data
minimization, accuracy, non-discrimination, fairness, and accountability
(Stoyanovich, Howe \& Jagadish, 2020). Complying with legal regulations
and preventing misuse are paramount, ensuring that any data collected is
with consent, is the minimum necessary, and is used in a manner that
avoids discriminatory practices and unauthorized purposes. While
publicly accessible information may seem readily available, using it
without consent can lead to ethical dilemmas and legal challenges in
certain jurisdictions. Therefore, alongside maintaining openness about
the data's origins and modifications, securing the data against
unauthorized access is a critical responsibility, requiring robust
storage and handling measures.
